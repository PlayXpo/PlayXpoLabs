        <h2>About the Role at PlayXpo</h2>
        <p>
            At PlayXpo, we’re always on the lookout for creative, passionate, and driven individuals who are excited to be part of the growing gaming and esports ecosystem in India. Whether you’re into design, strategy, marketing, community building, or content creation — there’s a space for you here.
        </p>
        <p>
            This opportunity is unpaid for now, as we are still building and bootstrapping. But what we offer is much more valuable: real experience, freedom to experiment, industry exposure, and a chance to contribute to a growing gaming platform that aims to connect gamers, creators, and innovators.
        </p>
        <p>
            We work flexibly — sometimes fast-paced, sometimes chill — depending on project needs. We value teamwork, communication, and respect for the sensitive nature of the projects we are building.
        </p>
        <h3>We’re looking for people who:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Think creatively and go beyond the ordinary.</li>
            <li>Can work independently and in a team setting.</li>
            <li>Are willing to commit their time consistently.</li>
            <li>Are excited to be part of something from the ground up.</li>
            <li>Have basic presence or are willing to build one on platforms like Discord, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If that sounds like you, choose your role in the next step and let’s grow together!
